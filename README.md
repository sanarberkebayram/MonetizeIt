# API Monetization Platform - MonetizeIt

This project is a production-capable platform that allows developers to publish APIs, set pricing plans, issue API keys, meter usage, enforce quotas, and handle billing/invoicing. The platform supports multiple billing models (per-request, per-data-volume, subscription tiers), usage analytics, and developer tooling (SDKs, CLI, dashboard).

## High-Level Architecture

```
Client -> API Gateway (auth, throttling, metering) -> Publisher Backend
                     |         |
                     |         -> Usage Events -> Event Bus (RedisStream) -> Billing Service
                     -> Metrics -> Time-series DB (Prometheus/)

Admin/Dev Portal -> Management API -> DB (Postgres) / Cache (Redis)
Billing Service -> Payment Provider (Stripe) -> Invoices
```

## Local Development

To get started with local development, you'll need to have Docker and Docker Compose installed.

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/monetizeit.git
    cd monetizeit/backend
    ```

2.  **Set up environment variables:**

    Create a `.env` file in the `management-api` directory and add the following environment variables:

    ```
    DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:example@postgres:5432/postgres
    ```

3.  **Run the application:**

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

    This will start all the services in the background. You can view the logs for each service using `docker-compose logs -f <service-name>`.

## Testing

To run the tests, you'll need to have `pytest` installed.

```bash
pip install pytest
```

Then, you can run the tests for each service by navigating to the service's directory and running `pytest`.

## Deployment

This project is designed to be deployed to a Kubernetes cluster. The deployment files are not yet included in this repository, but they will be added in a future release.
